## Usage

* `aplay`  â€“ looks for a file called `out.wav` and plays it
* `keepit` - moves `out.wav` to a uniquely-named file under `keepers/`

### Example workflow

1. Start `aplay`
2. Use [CDP](http://www.composersdesktop.com) to create a sample via the command-line. e.g.
`rm -f out.wav && modify revecho 1 whoa.wav out.wav 52 .90 0.71 16`
3. Do you like it? `keepit`

## Dependencies

```
brew install sox fswatch
```

## Tips

* To stop playing audio: ctrl-c
* To kill the auto-player: ctrl-z followed by `kill %`
